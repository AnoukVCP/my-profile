 		<h1>Hello, I'm Anouk</h1>

					My hobbies are listening to music, reading and watch movies.

		<h2>Music</h2>
			<p>
				Indeed music helps me to escape my daily life. I love all types of music: jazz, classical music but even rock and reggae. But my favorite group is Queen because I find them really innovative and atypical.

	<div class="card-white">
		<h2>Reading</h2>
			<p>
				I also really like to read and my favorite book is "The Help" from Kathryn Stockett because it is one of the book that moved me the most. My favorite type of book are indeed tragical books and I donâ€™t like so much entertaining books.
			</p>

	<div class="card-white">
		<h2>Watch movies</h2>
			<p>
				Finally I have a real passion for cinema and I can watch movies very different too. Like the books, it allows me to escape too and to dream, even more when it has its poetical part. The movie "I-Origins" is the one that had the biggest effect on me because it obliges you to ask yourself a lot of questions about the importance of the spiritual and the scientifical aspects on our lives and their eternal oppositions.
